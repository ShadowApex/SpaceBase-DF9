This is a listing of all the official bugs from the original v1.06 that i could find across the internet that need to be looked into.

Please add more if you find any. So far, they only need to be looked at or replicated as much as possible, but not fixed unless you can see the problem. We'll do bug fixes after releases and only on our stuff for starters. Churning out as much game data as possible is priority 1.

Bug: Oxygenation process in gamespeed changes
