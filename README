    We’re also pleased to announce we’ll be releasing the game’s full
    Lua source code a short time after 1.0, which will allow the
    community to create potentially far-ranging mods that add content,
    new features, and change some fundamental game behaviors.

    The game’s Lua source code is now available in the game’s install
    directory on all platforms. Usually this will be in your Steam
    directory, under SteamApps\common\SpacebaseDF9\Data\Scripts. If you
    own the game you can modify these files and distribute your
    modifications to other users as you like. A large portion of
    Spacebase is written in Lua, so there are relatively few limits on
    what you can do with this.

Installation
============

Linux: 

  $ ./linux_install.sh

This will copy the modified game files on top of your Steam installation
of the game (after backing it up of course!)  To restore the original
game, just run:

  $ ./linux_install.sh restore

Or else just direct Steam to re-install Spacebase DF-9.


Debugging
=========
To test events more quickly you can toggle the dev debug stuff so you
can generate a new list of events and activate them at your
will. There’s a good amount of info on debugging on the wiki.

See DebugMenu.lua for how to implement new debugging operations.

Code Style
==========
The code uses 'hungarian notation'.  For an explanation, see

  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2003/09/12/52989.aspx

We believe the meaning is:  n is Number, b is Boolean, t is Table, r is
Reference, e is Enum.
