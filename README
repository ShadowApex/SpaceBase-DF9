Spacebase DF-9 v2 - Space station building game

This is a community maintained fork of DoubleFine's original game, which
was open sourced May 12, 2015 under the Common Public Attribution
License (CPAL-1.0: http://opensource.org/licenses/cpal_1.0).  (See
Licensing History below for more discussion).


Installation
============

Linux: 

  $ ./linux_install.sh

This will copy the modified game files on top of your Steam installation
of the game (after backing it up of course!)  To restore the original
game, just run:

  $ ./linux_install.sh restore

Or else just direct Steam to re-install Spacebase DF-9.


Bugs
====
If you need to report a bug, please send us an email at spacebasehub at
gmail dot com, including your log file and a screenshot if you think
it'd be useful.  You can find your game log at:

  Windows
  <drive>:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\SpacebaseDF9\moai_log_space.txt 

  Linux
  ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/SpacebaseDF9/moai_log_Space.txt

If you can, also attach the save game located at:

  Windows
  <drive>:\Users\<your user name>\Documents\SpacebaseDF9\saves\ 

  Linux
  ~/.local/share/doublefine/spacebasedf9/Saves/


Debugging
=========
To test events more quickly you can toggle the dev debug stuff so you
can generate a new list of events and activate them at your
will. There’s a good amount of info on debugging on the wiki.

See DebugMenu.lua for how to implement new debugging operations.


Contributing
============
Derelict Games is at heart a collaborative open source project, and
as such welcomes community contributions.  You're welcome to send
new art, one-off patches, content suggestions, and good ideas via the
usual bug reporting instructions outlined above.

Those wishing to do more substantial code contributions may wish to look
at our repository on gitlab.  Send us a pull request if you have
something cool to include.

If you'd like to participate more deeply and directly, that's great!
We've got a "2 contributions" rule as an entry requirement, so get a
couple patches accepted, or thumbs up from the art crew on a couple
pieces of art or sound or whatnot.  Then, just ask one of the current
team and we'll get you hooked in!


Code Style
==========
The code uses 'hungarian notation'.  For an explanation, see

  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2003/09/12/52989.aspx

We believe the meaning is:  n is Number, b is Boolean, t is Table, r is
Reference, e is Enum.

    We’re also pleased to announce we’ll be releasing the game’s full
    Lua source code a short time after 1.0, which will allow the
    community to create potentially far-ranging mods that add content,
    new features, and change some fundamental game behaviors.

    The game’s Lua source code is now available in the game’s install
    directory on all platforms. Usually this will be in your Steam
    directory, under SteamApps\common\SpacebaseDF9\Data\Scripts. If you
    own the game you can modify these files and distribute your
    modifications to other users as you like. A large portion of
    Spacebase is written in Lua, so there are relatively few limits on
    what you can do with this.
