* What was the most recently added feature to the game?  Make doubly
  sure to test that one extra hard, since it'll have received the least
  testing during development.

* Make sure all items added have necessary artwork and icons, not just
  placeholder art.  Otherwise the game will look incomplete to users.

* Make sure several people have played the release candidate at least an
  hour each before releasing, to make sure there aren't any head-slapper
  dumb bugs that everyone's going to run into.

* Have at least one different person test each of the release packages
  (ideally on virgin systems) BEFORE posting them on the website, to
  catch installer goofs.

* Have there been any significant changes to the UI?  If so, make sure
  to document the changes prominently in the release.  Inevitably
  *someone* will find them confusing.  And sometimes the simple act of
  documenting them will help in spotting usability clunkiness -- if it
  takes a lot of words to describe the change, the UI is probably not as
  efficient as it should be.

* Remember that especially for games, a picture is worth a thousand
  words.  Nice, well-composed screenshots can be the best way to
  showcase our changes.
