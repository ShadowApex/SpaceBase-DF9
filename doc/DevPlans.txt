Spacebase DF-9 Dev Plans

TECHNOLOGY
* top-level research screen showing all possible projects, completed and non

ASSIGN PEOPLE TO ROOMS
* depending on their duty and/or zone type, this can mean different things:
** assign a security-duty citizen to a room to have them guard it
** assign a technician to a room to have them focus their work on it
** assign any citizen to a residence to have them use it as their quarters
* normally, a citizen will "claim" an unused bed and the area around it
** citizens decorate their living space with their stuff (see "stuff" above)
* people protect their spaces / become annoyed when strangers or unfriendly people intrude

CARRYABLE OBJECTS
* new citizen inspector tab showing stuff stashed in inventory
* when people arrive, they have a suitcase (container with their stuff in it)
* players build shelves for people to put their stuff on
* replicator food comes in wrappers, produces waste (litter carryable)
* a single item of stuff can have multiple tags describing it, eg purple, terran, fuzzy, punk rock, etc.  citizens have affinities for these tags
* citizens trade stuff with each other, trying to get stuff they like more
* roaming traders will visit the base to trade new stuff with people
** traders enter the base and build a "trading post" in a reasonable location, people go to it
* "litter" objects that citizens with low neatness personality throw away
* janitors / people with high neatness pick up litter
* janitors clean up bloodstains and other cosmetic damage
* people gibbed by monsters turn into bits, which janitors must clean up
* citizens have to reach a locker before they can change duty
* duty gear exists in-world, citizens must find it and equip themselves to do duty

POWER SYSTEM
* "reactor zone" with fusion reactor object that produces power
* rooms must be adjacent to a room with a working reactor to be powered
* unpowered rooms go dark (emergency lighting) and objects in them don't function
* reactors only produce X power, then you have to build another
* a room's power demand is determined by its size and the objects in it
* maybe make the Base Seed object serves as a low-output reactor to help players get started
* power viz mode: rooms are green/yellow/red to show adequate/partial/no power, specific objects red when unpowered
* factor new need for reactors into starting matter allotment

BASE DEFENSE
* auto turrets, placeable on base exterior or in rooms
* like other machines, turrets draw power, probably a lot to make it difficult to construct an invincible amount of them

BASE HISTORY SCREEN
* a permanent timestamped list of important base events: citizen joined, citizen died, ship docked, first zone of each type created
* in-game screenshot key that pops up a "write a caption for this screenshot" box, screenshot + caption is added to the timestamped list
* base history is stored locally in save dir as HTML + linked images, each base has its own dir
* base history is also mirrored on a hosted server somewhere, players can easily link their base histories

MISC LIFE SIM
* citizens become annoyed if their environment is noisy (people passing through or doing stuff) while sleeping or relaxing - incentivize building residences that are low-traffic
* "watch video" activity tied to monitors
* high morale = skills go up more quickly

MISC UI
* replace global O2 capacity HUD box with O2-viz-mode-only display: X/Y capacity #s over each chunk of contiguous (ie sharing the same O2 supply) base geo

TECHNOLOGY
* open-ended "research mystery tech" task, has a chance to discover a "secret" project
* doctors must research cures for slow-killer diseases
* in-place upgrading of lvl 1 objects if you've researched a cooler version

FOOD/GARDENS
* improperly maintained food replicators produce bad food that makes people sick?

CLAIM/DISCLAIM ROOMS
* if all rooms in a derelict are unclaimed+dim or undiscovered for long enough, the entire derelict "drifts away"

MINIMAP
* minimap display of base in lower right corner
* separate viz mode toggles for minimap vs main view

DOCKING SHIPS
* Tetris-piece-style placement for docking ships (friendly and hostile) so that you have control over where a ship appears, making it less disruptive to base development.
* ability to tell security to breach a locked door

MULTI-LEVEL BASE CONSTRUCTION
* UI for navigating multiple levels
* rendering tech for showing multiple levels
* build gravshafts to allow citizens to travel between levels
* ability to build railings for safety?

SPACEFACE LOGS
* support "all lower case" personality flag
* use a linecode's recency as another score-impacting variable (reduce repetition)
* "comment on thing in environment" - save list of recent objects nearby

"LEARN TO PLAY"
* option in front/pause menu
* loads Box.sav as starting map, as opposed to normal DeepSpace.sav
* "only display once" hint flag for tutorialish / first time messages
* add "time since last true" concept to hint system
* add "has been true since X" concept to hint system

TELEPORTERS
* build at least two "teleport pad" objects to create a functioning teleporter
* UI for selecting which teleporter goes where (dynamically changeable)
* teleporter accidents: poorly maintained teleporters could hurt/kill people, scramble their brains (personality change), turn them evil (goatee Spock)

METEOR STRIKES
* shield generators generate shielding to repel meteor strikes (gives technicians stuff to do in space)

MISC UI
* ticker along bottom edge of screen showing recent notable spaceface updates
* confirm + cancel for roster screen
* custom viz for Construct mode - desaturate colors except for amber building color?
* shift-space = max speed
* up/down arrows in room centers showing whether room O2 is rising or lowering
* "object condition" viz mode: color-code objects by condition, highlight technicians?  do same when a technician is selected?
* allow zoom in beyond min_zoom, spring back to normal min_zoom after a few seconds
* make ability to rename citizens "once only"
* "no power" icon over unpowered rooms (once power system exists)
* little lines showing where someone is pathing to
* support Mac trackpad gestures
* dev shortcut list for edit mode?

BASE STATS SCREEN
* auto-show stats screen after base fails, ie everyone dies, "game over" state
stats to show:
* Matter spent
* Derelicts
* Hostile docking
* Total docks
* Non-hostile docks
* Docking requests denied, accepted, forced
* Room temp
* Raiders killed
* Monsters killed

EMERGENCY DISTRESS SIGNAL
* (very expensive?) object you can build that calls for rescue people / immigrants to show up and save your base

BASE NAMING
* when your first oxygenated room comes online, base is considered "established" and prompts you for a name

STEAM WORKSHOP
* built in savegame sharing!
* mod support!
** "mods" subdir where user-created scripts patch base game lua files at runtime
** provide uncompiled lua source for gameplay-relevant classes, eg Character.lua, to support modders
** allow PNG sprite sheets - lower performance than tex format in exchange for easy moddability

BARTENDERS
* citizen drunkenness - increased by X every drink they have, dwindles to zero slowly (ie "blood alcohol")
* drunk citizens more likely to make mistakes while doing duty

CITIZEN FIGHTING
* citizens who dislike each other enough will fight
* low risk of actual death, but injury and deepening mutual hatred
* security can stun violent people to calm them down, knocking them unconscious for a bit
* drunk citizens more likely to fight
* low morale citizens far more likely to fight

MENTAL HEALTH
* when morale is critically low, depending on personality type:
** sit in bed moping
*** friends visit the depressed citizen and bring them space-soup, attempting to cheer them up
** become violent, grabbing a rifle if available, attacking random people

DOCTORS
* doctor duty and infirmary zone
* doctors unassigned to an infirmary (see "assining people to rooms") patrol the base looking for hurt/sick people
* citizens seek out an infirmary/doctor when hurt or sick (eg parasite infestation)
* doctors use tricorder-like first aid prop to heal people
** better doctors heal people faster / more fully, bad doctors have a chance to hurt them
* revivabed object for infirmary: only way to detect parasite infestation or cure some diseases
* cold viruses can be transmitted between citizens via chat and proximity
** having a cold saps stamina and has morale impact

CONSTRUCTION TOOLS
* "flood fill with floor" tool, works on areas enclosed by walls or asteroid
* "build circular room" tool - drag out a circular area instead of a square
* filled (with floor) vs unfilled (without floor) toggle for box and circle room tools

* ability to flag any citizens as hostile / suspicious (security will keep an eye on them)
* sportsball matches viewable on monitors / in pubs
* jukeboxes in pubs that play player-selected music on command
* citizens form bands and play gigs together
** songs bands write can be about real things a citizen has experienced
* citizens create artwork
** art depicts real things a citizen has experienced / concepts a citizen knows about

SOCIALIZATION / AFFINITY AI
* people have +/- affinities for duties, and will become unhappy doing a duty they dislike for too long, even if they're good at it - players must balance needs of citizen versus needs of base
* people prefer to chat with friends, unless they have high gregarious personality in which case they actively enjoy chatting with strangers (low familiarity)
* people have +/- affinities for objects and rooms with certain qualities, eg red, dark, fluffy
* people have +/- affinities for people with certain qualities (xenophobia/philia, sexual preference, fashion sense)
* people spread gossip about people they dislike, biasing affinity map changes against them
* trends: popular (high aggregate affinity) people influence the affinities of less popular people
** trends are spread via chat, ie "memes", very similiar to viruses
** "meme susceptible" personality trait, analogous to immunodefense strength
* fashion accessories signify social affiliation, eg cliques wear the same kind of thing
* new concepts (topics) are gradually introduced by immigrants and trade, eg a new fasion craze starts when a trader visits the base with slap bracelets
* if morale is good, choose topics that you like, converse if morale is bad?

PERSONALITY TRAITS
* introverted/extroverted = how much people enjoy solitary vs group activities
* gregarious/shy = how much people enjoy chatting with strangers vs friends

"VISIT A FRIEND'S BASE"
* hangar bay zone where shuttles can dock
** (post "stuff" update, traders show up here)
** "landing pad" env object needed to demonstrate footprint
** "hangar door", like airlock door but wider
** room depressurizes when hangar door is open, represurrizes when closed then people can disembark
* load citizens onto a shuttle and give it a destination friend's base
* shuttle leaves, your friend gets a visit request
* if accepted, your citizens disembark inside their base, walk around and have adventures
* eventually, they return to the shuttle and return to your base
* travelers preserve any stuff, gained experience, technology etc that they accrue while visiting another base

BASE DEFENSE

** each goal can be suspended and resumed at any point

FUNERALS
* when they die, depending on religious(?) preference each citizen will either be recycled at the matter recycler, or given a "spock funeral" ie placed in a spacecoffin and sent out an airlock
