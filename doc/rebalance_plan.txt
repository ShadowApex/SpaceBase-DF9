Spacebase DF-9 rebalance plan

Each time a hostile event will trigger, a difficulty rating will be determined.

difficulty rating = location modifier * population modifier * game type modifier

location modifier = location is selected at beginning of game
population modifier = modifier based on population
game type modifier = 2 game types, Losing is Fun is harder, difficulty will progress faster and you will inevitably lose.  Building is Fun is easier, with a slower difficulty progression, you will be able to build large bases with this game type.

Each hostile event will have a minimum difficulty rating, if it fires with a lower difficulty rating than the minimum a new one will be selected.

Remove "end game raider event", might put back in, might not.
