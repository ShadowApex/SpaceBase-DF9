Spacebase DF-9 rebalance plan

Each time a hostile event will trigger, a difficulty rating will be determined.

difficulty rating = location modifier * population modifier * game type modifier

location modifier = location is selected at beginning of game
population modifier = modifier based on population
game type modifier = 2 game types, Losing is Fun is harder, difficulty will progress faster and you will inevitably lose.  Building is Fun is easier, with a slower difficulty progression, you will be able to build large bases with this game type.

prereqs: min/max pop, play time elapsed, specific buildings, credits, num turrets, military strength, medical knowledge

For each event create a table of potential events based on prereqs, then pick a random one.  Keep a record of the last one/two to try make sure hostile events don't happen too often.
For hostile event, modify event based on difficulty rating

O2Gen line - I'm thinking we increase the cost and increase the amount of 02 generated.
